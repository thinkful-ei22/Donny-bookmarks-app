# Fundamentals Final Project
## Build a Bookmarks App

### Project Overview
Using everything you've learned over the Fundamentals section of the course, you will build the frontend for an API-powered Bookmarks application that lets the user store and rate their custom web bookmarks.

###  Implemented

As a user:
* I can add bookmarks to my bookmark list. Bookmarks contain:
  * title
  * url link
  * description
  * rating (1-5)

* I can see a list of my bookmarks when I first open the app
  * All bookmarks in the list default to a "condensed" view showing only title and rating

* I can click on a bookmark to display the "detailed" view
  * Detailed view expands to additionally display description and a "Visit Site" link

* I can remove bookmarks from my bookmark list

* I receive appropriate feedback when I cannot submit a bookmark
  * Check all validations in the API documentation (e.g. `title` and `url` field required)

* I can select from a dropdown a "minimum rating" to filter the list by all bookmarks rated above the chosen selection

### To Do

* (Extension) I can edit the rating and description of a bookmark in my list
* Implement custom functionality
* Make UI SeXy
